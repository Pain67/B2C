# B2C
Convert Binary data into c/c++ header file.

### Usage

b2c <source_file_path> [options]:

- <source_file_path> (Required): Full path to the file to be coverted
- [options] (Optional): Any of the following options / flags:
  - -o <target_file_name>: File name for the resulting file.
  - -t {c,cpp}: Specifies the out file format. Default: "c"
  - -n <name>: Specifies the name of the data array generated from source file.
  - -nop: No progress printed, even if source file size above the limit
  - -p: Progress will be printed even if source file size below the limit
  - -ps <N>: Set the progress printing steps. Print progress status after every N bytes
  - -c : Output file will be compact (no spaces or new lines)
  - -r <N> : Sets the number of elements in a row (for the data array)


### Example
```
b2c sourcefile.bin -o targetfile -t cpp -n data -p -ps 30000 -r 32
```
this will read 'sourcefile.bin' and writes it's content as a 'cpp' source file into 'targetfile.cpp'. In the created file, the name of the array will be 'data' and an additional constant will be defined as 'data_length' with the number of bytes in the 'data' array. ('?_length' always defined where '?' is the name of the array). During the process, it will log 'progress' after every 30,000 bytes. (Showing % completed and estiamted bytes written per second). The generated file will contains 32 elements per row.

### Output

using b2c on the "LICENCE" with the following command:
```
b2c LICENSE -t hpp -r 32 -n data
```
Will generate the below output:

```c++
const char data[847] = {
